# ReadySystem
A system to indicate readiness of two different teams participating in some kind of activity

The project contains a REST service which is run on a Tomcat server.
Enclosed is also an index html file, a css(which is rather poorly done) and a javascript which is issuing both GET and POST request to the server.

At a later stage, the arduino code for the hardware components will issue a POST request to the server, telling it which team is ready and which is not.

The code is derived from examples given by mkyoung. The code is reflecting this.
